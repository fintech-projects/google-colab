## Project overview:

With the COVID pandemic continuing to impact lives and businesses globally and into the foreseeable future, technology and machine learning has the ability to innovate processes for businesses. In particular the restaurant and cafe industry has felt the effects of the pandemic with lockdowns and impact on trade.

This project aims to help the restaurants and cafes with a new and innovative method for customers placing orders, which reduces staff face-to-face contact with customers. Many businesses have found they needed to adapt their business models to cope with the effects of the pandemic. 

With this implementation, the customer could show the food item selection of number from the menu items with the fingers number display onto camera from browser which captures the live photo and then with thumbs up as "Make Order" or thumbs down as "Order Cancel" 

## Business case:

Order-Mate is offered to businesses on a month-to-month subscription basis with no lock in contract. The first month is offered free as a trial and businesses are offered an additional month free for referring another business. Monthly billing is $200AUD via direct debit.

Order-Mate seeks growth via organic referrals from businesses and consumers alike, with a strong focus on the Australian market. Order-Mate also seeks out key partnerships with large franchises and businesses where "enterprise" solutions are offered at discounted rate based on the volume of businesses.

Order-Mate's key reveneue stream is monthly subscription, however, Order-Mate is seeking key partnerships with advertisers to boost revenue via adverstising within the application.

### Instructions or pre-requisites to run the Notebook - predict_live_image.ipynb in Google Colab 

<ul>
  <li>Google Colab runtime selection as "GPU"</li>

  <li>Create_model.ipynb should be run before the prediction file and the saved model should be uploaded to Google Colab prior to predict_live_image file run</li>

  <li>When predict_live_image.ipynb is run, the input image is predicted with the model</li>

  <li>From "Capture Live Photo" section - Click on "Capture" button to save live image - while capturing the live image it is preferred with plain background of light color and show finger count only to camera rather than with background noises or human faces - this is a limitation in the model trained and will be upgraded in future version when time permits</li>
