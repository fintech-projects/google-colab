## Instructions or pre-requisites to run the Notebook - predict_live_image.ipynb in Google Colab 

<ul>
  <li>Ensure the Google Colab runtime is selected as "GPU"</li>
  <li>First run the Finger_detection.ipynb to create and save the Fingers.h5 model in google colab contents folder</li>
  <li>Second run the predict_live_image.ipynb</li>
  <li>Capture live image with plain background with light color and show finger count only to camera rather than with background noises or human faces - this is a limitation in the model trained and will be upgraded in future when time permits</li>
  <li>Upload kaggle.json when prompted</li>
</ul>
